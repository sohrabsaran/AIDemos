# Purpose of this Repository
This repository contains demos and a record of my knowledge in the conventional field of AI. A sort of extended resume.

# License
This is licensed under MIT. If I have explained something well in my code or documentation, then please link to that code or document to acknowledge.

#Google Docs
I find google docs much easier to edit and maintain than .md files. My top-level google doc that gives an overview of AI and ML can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JSq7Kq6G61wOvT5zOIAFjT5TSe8t7la9rz1ClHGmu2A/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
